        @param _maxPlayersCount max quantity of players allowed to join the game
        @param _incentiveToken optional token address used to provide additional incentives to users. Accepts "0x0" adresses when no incentive token exists.
        @param _incentiveController matic reward claim contract.
        @param _matic matic token address.
        @param _merkleRoot merkle root to verify players on chain to allow only whitelisted users join.
